This week I have an article about Scotland's finances in The Spectator in which I argue that Scotland's fiscal position is unsustainable, and that its government expenditure per capita is only feasible due to cross-subsidisation from the rest of the United Kingdom. I then give my best attempt at a steel man for Scottish independence, and then discuss why I'm still not convinced.
