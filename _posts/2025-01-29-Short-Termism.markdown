After an ill-received first budget, in which the government have felt forced to back away from
many of their announced measures, Rachel Reeves and the treasury have expressed hopes to see
an improvement in GDP growth by [March](https://www.thetimes.com/comment/columnists/article/restless-reeves-seeks-cure-for-growing-pains-zcdv5q3hv). She must however beware the dangers of asking to
be judged on an economic measure that is both prone to mismeasurement and easily influenced
by external factors.

If the goal of Rachel Reeves is to improve growth in the next two months, this humble citizen has
several suggestions that would doubtless accomplish the mission. His favourite of these is to
announce a Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) holiday lasting for three months, preferably with no
price threshold. There is some precedent for this, with the last one ending under Sunak’s
chancellorship in June 2021. The temporarily increased rate of property turnover, as well as the
rise in activity among associated industries such as legal services and retail banking, would almost
certainly assist the Chancellor to meet her aim of increasing GDP growth by March. There is
however a problem with this policy – it would not increase overall economic flourishing, and
instead simply moves forward transactions which would have taken place anyway while also
cheating HM Treasury out of much-needed expenditure.

There is a now outdated joke among economists that if a man marries his housekeeper, the GDP
of the country would be diminished. Like most jokes in economics, it’s not particularly funny, but
it does serve to illustrate an important point about the disconnect between the creation of real
economic value and how it is captured by national accounting formulae.

Many a Chancellor has exploited this disconnect to manipulate economic statistics to suit their
own agenda, whether that be achieving key economic milestones in a timely manner or placating
fellow politicians and voters when their job looks under threat. It is also a method by which an
outgoing Chancellor can hurriedly empty the piggy bank to ensure the next government will have
little spending to play with - a deeply irresponsible, yet often used, tactic.

Luckily for Labour though, there is plenty of time for their economic reforms to pay dividends,
since they can expect another 4 years in power, and can hope for far more. There is thus no need
to resort to distorting economic output just yet, and the government should worry less about the
state of the economy in March 2025 and more about how it looks in 2029. Labour cannot be
blamed for looking for a quick win to oﬀset what has undoubtably been a harrowing first six
months in oﬀice, but the obsession shown with short term economic targets is strongly reminiscent
of the Chancellorship of Mr Kwarteng, an economic episode few want to repeat.

An example of this short-termism can be seen from Reeves’ recent meetings at Davos and the
attempts to woo international business and investors to bring their capital to Great Britain. While
this may help plug the current holes in Britain’s finances, it does not address the fundamental
reasons that have led to international businesses and high net worth individuals leaving the United
Kingdom in droves. To say Britain lacks economic growth due to lacking investment gets things
the wrong way round; if British companies oﬀer strong returns, investors will flock to them. Build
It and They Will Come is as applicable to international capital markets as it is to the ghost of
Shoeless Joe.

Many of Labour’s current plans which have the greatest chance of long-term success will have
almost no immediate impact on output, but have been introduced nonetheless in the hopes that
they will usher a return to Cool Britannia. An example of this is their commitment to reforming
the planning process, which has the potential to drastically reduce the housing shortage over the
coming decades. The government could however be far bolder and should aim to introduce key
reforms aimed at improving growth while they still have the political will to do so. Tax policy in
particular contains many opportunities for growth and remains within the Chancellor’s purview,
yet we saw essentially no tax reform or simplification in the October budget. At the next budget,
Reeves should seize some of these opportunities to improve long-term growth for example by
reducing the UK’s VAT threshold, which discourages businesses from expanding, or reforming
council tax to better reflect modern property values.

The figures released by the ONS in March are largely irrelevant to Reeves’ goal of returning Britain
to the global stage, and the Chancellor shouldn’t let them distract her from her underlying mission.
If achieving this requires some discomfort in the short-term, then so be it; just fix things before
you face the ballot.
