I'm currently an economics Research Assistant at [St John's College](https://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk), Oxford University. My primary academic fields of interest are economics, finance, and business although I am interested in most things. I'm also a 2025 [Emergent Ventures](https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures) Fellow. 

While an undergraduate at The University of Edinburgh, I worked for two years as a policy caseworker for a government minister. I also interned within the government economic service, the Scottish Fiscal Commission, and a policy thinktank. I'm therefore very interested in politics and public policy.

This website serves as a library of my past writings and thought. I'm quite embarrassed by some of my older writing, but most of the time I don't care enough to remove it.

You can get in touch with me via email [here](mailto:kyle.j.macleod2001@outlook.com).
